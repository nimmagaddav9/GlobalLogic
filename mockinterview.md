# ✅ Section 1: Technical Backend – Node.js, APIs, Algorithms

### Q1. How do you design a scalable Node.js backend for a high-traffic application?

**Answer:**

I follow a modular, layered architecture where routes, controllers, services, and utilities are separated. I use asynchronous programming via `async/await` to maximize non-blocking I/O. For scalability:

- I use a load balancer (like AWS ALB) with stateless APIs.
- I implement clustering using PM2 or native Node.js clusters.
- Caching is handled with Redis or DynamoDB DAX.
- Rate limiting and request validation are enforced to avoid abuse.
- I design the system to be horizontally scalable and deploy using AWS Lambda or ECS depending on the workload.

### Q2. Explain an algorithmic problem you solved in a backend project.

**Answer:**

In a real-time dashboard project, we needed to group and sort large datasets on the fly. I implemented a trie-based approach for auto-complete on the server-side, which reduced search time complexity to O(k) where k is the word length. For sorting complex nested JSON data, I used a custom merge sort for stability and performance, which allowed pagination on the fly for large data chunks.

# ✅ Section 2: Frontend – React.js, State Management

### Q3. How do you structure a React project for large-scale applications?

**Answer:**

For scalable React apps:

- I follow feature-based folder structure (`features/Auth`, `features/Dashboard`, etc.).
- I use Redux Toolkit for predictable state management.
- I encapsulate reusable components with Storybook and apply atomic design principles.
- For API calls, I use RTK Query or `axios` with interceptors.
- I implement lazy loading, code splitting (`React.lazy`/`Suspense`), and error boundaries.
- Testing is done using Jest and React Testing Library.
- For styling, I prefer CSS Modules or styled-components for scoped styles.

### Q4. How do you optimize a React application for performance?

**Answer:**

- Memoization with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
- Debouncing input handlers to limit re-renders.
- Avoiding prop drilling with Context or Redux.
- Dynamic import for routes/components.
- Virtualization for large lists using libraries like `react-window`.

# ✅ Section 3: AWS and Cloud

### Q5. How have you used AWS in your recent projects?

**Answer:**

In a recent microservices project:

- I hosted the frontend on **S3 with CloudFront** for CDN.
- Backend APIs were built with **AWS Lambda** behind **API Gateway**.
- **DynamoDB** was used for NoSQL data.
- **Cognito** handled authentication.
- I used **Step Functions** for orchestrating serverless workflows.
- For logging and observability, I used **CloudWatch Logs**, **X-Ray**, and **SNS** for alerts.

---

### Q6. What’s your approach to building serverless applications in AWS?

**Answer:**

I follow a “function per route” design using the **Serverless Framework**. I ensure:

- IAM roles are minimal and scoped.
- Cold start issues are minimized using provisioned concurrency where needed.
- Monitoring is built-in with **CloudWatch dashboards**.
- CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins) deploy automatically to dev/stage/prod.

# ✅ Section 4: CI/CD & DevOps

### Q7. What CI/CD tools have you used and how do you set up a pipeline?

**Answer:**

I've used **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, and **GitLab CI**. For a typical pipeline:

- On commit, code is linted, unit tested, and built.
- Artifacts are stored (e.g., S3 or Docker registry).
- Infrastructure as code (e.g., with Terraform or CloudFormation) provisions resources.
- For serverless, I deploy with **Serverless Framework** or **AWS SAM**.
- I include approval steps for production deployment.

# ✅ Section 5: Architecture and Design

### Q8. How do you approach enterprise-level architecture design?

**Answer:**

I focus on:

- Domain-driven design to define boundaries.
- Microservices with separate data sources.
- Communication via REST or GraphQL APIs.
- Circuit breakers and retries using libraries like `axios-retry` or Hystrix pattern.
- Shared contracts using OpenAPI specs.
- Event-driven patterns using AWS SNS/SQS or Kafka.
- Observability (structured logging, tracing, metrics).

---

### Q9. What’s the role of caching in distributed systems and what tools do you use?

**Answer:**

Caching reduces latency and backend load. I use:

- **Redis or Memcached** for in-memory caching.
- **DynamoDB DAX** for read-heavy NoSQL use cases.
- CDN-level caching with **CloudFront**.

I use cache invalidation strategies like TTLs or event-based invalidation to keep data fresh.

# ✅ Section 6: Bonus – GraphQL, NoSQL

### Q10. What’s your experience with GraphQL?

**Answer:**

I’ve implemented GraphQL APIs using **Apollo Server** with **Node.js** and **TypeScript**. On the frontend, I use **Apollo Client**. I define schemas using SDL, resolve queries with resolvers, and handle batching and caching with **DataLoader**. I use directives for authentication and handle pagination using cursor-based approach.

### Q11. Compare NoSQL and SQL – when do you use NoSQL?

**Answer:**

**NoSQL is ideal for:**

- High write throughput
- Schemaless or flexible data
- Hierarchical or nested data (e.g., documents in MongoDB or DynamoDB)

I use NoSQL when:

- The data model is flexible
- Low latency is a must
- Horizontal scaling is critical

**SQL is better for:**

- Relational data
- Complex queries with joins
- Strong consistency requirements
